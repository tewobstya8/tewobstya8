# 🌸 Hi there, I'm Hana Minaleshewa

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm a curious and committed **Computer Science student** with a growing passion for **Software Development**, **Infrastructure**, and **Documentation**.

I'm currently doing an internship where I'm learning real-world skills like deployment, networking, and writing beginner-friendly technical guides. My journey may have just started — but I'm giving it my all every day 🚀.
