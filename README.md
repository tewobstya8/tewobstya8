# I'm Hana Minaleshewa

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm a curious and committed **Computer Science student** with a growing passion for **Software Development**, **Infrastructure**, and **Documentation**.

I'm currently doing an internship where I'm learning real-world skills like deployment, networking, and writing beginner-friendly technical guides. My journey may have just started — but I'm giving it my all every day .



## My Skills

###  Programming Languages
- **Python** – my go-to for learning logic and solving problems
- **Java** – learning to build structured, object-oriented applications
- **HTML & CSS** – used to design basic webpages
- **JavaScript** – just starting, and excited to learn more!

### Tools & Technologies
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and collaboration
- **Docker** (learning)
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** – exploring it during my internship
- **Markdown** – for writing clean, simple documentation

### Soft Skills
- Clear and beginner-friendly documentation writing
- Eager to learn and ask questions
- Honest, hardworking, and detail-focused
- Able to explain technical steps simply


## Currently Learning
- How to deploy services in real environments (like **eSignet On-Prem**)
- Writing professional technical documentation from scratch
- Becoming more confident in real development environments


## What I'm Working On
I'm currently writing a full beginner-style documentation for **eSignet On-Prem Installation** at DPI. My goal is to make it:
- Clear for both developers and non-technical users
- Step-by-step and easy to follow
- Something my supervisor and team can be proud of


##  Let’s Connect!
I’m always open to learning, improving, and connecting with kind, curious people.
